Substantial
-----------

* Languages, and how they're used
* (Czecho-)Slovak gamedev community 
  (companies, communities/groups, conferences)
* Middleware: basecode libraries (SDL2, SFML, PyGame)
* Middleware: Game engines (Unreal4, CryEngine, Unity3D)
* Game AI (techniques, applications. no details, no theory - but references)
* Interfaces: input (keyboard/gamepad/touchscreen/movement tracking)
* Interfaces: output (2D screen, web, VR, AR)
* Gaming hardware, differences and tradeoffs
* Getting resources (sound, graphics, etc.) (finding, hiring, etc.)
* Shaders/GPU programming.
* OpenGL/Vulkan/graphics programming (sending/retrieving data to/from GPU,
  concepts like vertex buffers, frame buffers, render passes, transparency,
  vertex/pixel formats (including e.g. sizeof vertices), indexing in VBOs,
  GPU command queues, etc.)
* Level design (with a dead-simple 'editor webapp' for some simple game (like Arkanoid from IHRA?))
* Financing (publishers, ads, early access, crowdfunding, steam/gog/desura, f2p), budgeting, creatively lowering costs (art direction, etc.)

* Sales & Marketing (gaming media, traditional ads, effective targeting with ads, viral/direct marketing)
  part of it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BCg31KVJok
* Writing, story, lore, dialogues
* Community management (forums, social networks, involving active community members)
* Modding (from the game developer's POV)
* Creative control (publishers, middleware licenses, steam/gog/desura)
* Distribution platforms (steam/gog/desura(dead? - replace by itch.io/indiegamestand), appstore/googleplay)
* 3D animation (keyframes, rigs, IK, procedural, etc.)
* Multiplayer (from gameplay POV), + some light notes on networking
* Physics (what is feasible, basic idea on how it works)
* making 2D graphics - doesn't fit into the 3D graphics topic

Inspiration
-----------

* Player choice versus story
* Art style of the game (about consistent art direction, etc -
  see e.g. Poco Eco from GameDays, old Shiny games, etc.)
* Demoscene (wow factor & inspiration about procedural generation - nothing more)
* History of computer games (from developer's standpoint) 
  - maybe similar to '10 gaming gods' from old LEVEL?
* Procedural generation (graphics, maps, content)
