Overview
--------

* **Start**

  - Simple game with a simple framework
  - Form teams, come up with game project ideas

* **Core**

  - *Continually* work on those game projects
  - While watching high-level topic talks

* **End**

  - Present your game
  - Interact with real game devs :superscript:`tm`

-----
Start
-----

TODO dates instead of 'till next time/ in two weeks' - based on exact year



* **You are here**: A very simple game using a very simple framework
* **Form teams**:

  - 2-4 people/team
  - **Send team member names** to `kiithsacmp@gmail.com` *till next time*

* **Game idea**:

  - Come up with something **in two weeks** and **send** to `kiithsacmp@gmail.com`

    **Contents**: Basic game mechanics, story (if applicable), language/framework

    The project *may* deviate from this idea over time



----
Core
----

* **Work** on your game, in your team

  - Stand-up meeting every week (stand-up part not mandatory)
  - Use anything as long as legal

    * Make your own engine/language/OS/CPU if you want
    * Or do something not insane
    * Or even use the simple framework presented
* **Topic talks**

  - Order-independent, high-level
  - With links to further resources - use to improve your game

---
End
---

TODO exact dates of 'second-to-last/last/etc.' set depending on year

* **before last-1 talk**:

  Send working game and source to `kiithsacmp@gmail.com`

  - **recommend testing on more than one machine first**

  - The game can be for any platform/s

    More/many platforms will help in evaluation, but is not
    *necessary* for full score, and should not be forced (e.g. PC->mobile)

  - Recommend at least Win7 or Linux (PC) / Android (mobile)

    (- so it can be tested; otherwise may need to show the game working in person)

---
End
---

* **Last talk**: game presentations & **live gameplay**

  - Bring a machine with your game (or install it here)
  - Meet local game devs who will present their teams/projects
  - Present your game with slides in 5 minutes

    * **or** avoid that by creating a *public* video on YouTube/Vimeo/etc

      similar to e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhI-Loe60i4

  - See others play your game; play other's games.



----------
Evaluation
----------

TODO depends on whether the subject is graded;
if not (best case), we can throw this out
and replace with 'make a game => absolvoval'

Mandatory:
  * Presentation or video (**10-20pt**)
  * Your game (**20-75pt**)

    - To guarantee 75pt, be better than the competition:

      http://sccg.sk/~mferko/tdh/?page_id=9

* Work over time ("stand-up" meetings, questions, etc.) (**0-15pt**)
* A new topic with slides/resources [#]_: (**20pt** per topic)
* A minor fix in slides/resources: (**1pt** per fix)
* Enter IHRA [#]_ (**10pt**), send and present your game there (**10pt**)
