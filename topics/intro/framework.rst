An easy-to-use framework is needed for the intro game-making exercise and as a fallback
for (likely the majority of) people who won't want to use their own tools.

------------
Requirements
------------

* No visual programming (App Inventor), nothing genre-limited (RPG Maker), 
  no functional programming (Not everyone can do it), no 'teaching tool' (Logo, Scratch)
* Must be capable enough to make a sellable game (even if e.g 2D only)
* Must run (and generate games running) on at least Windows, Linux, OSX
* Must be easy to start with
  - and to set up (dependencies+download+install) *in 10 minutes or so*
* Preferrably open source (but **not** GPL/any copyleft) or 'open-like' like Unreal Engine 4
  - Note the *sellable* part above
* Must not require payment to get started
* Must have a wealth of *freely accessible* learning resources (tutorials etc.)

----------
Candidates
----------

* Love2D
* Godot? (need research)
* Unreal Engine 4? (... probably overkill)
* Future: Unity3D? (Linux support is planned) (overkill?)
* **add more**

--------------
Not candidates
--------------

* Blender Game Engine
* OGRE/Irrlicht/etc.
